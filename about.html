<h1 id="start-up">Startup Ventures</h1>
<p id="p1">At the age of 18, James came up with the idea for his startup University Review. The idea derived from a problem 
inside a very overlooked industry, Edtech. The problem? A very complex and overwhemling college search process. The
solution? Simplify it. At the age of 19 he turned it into an LLC and hired his first Swift (IOS) developer to create its 
mobile app. Unable to hire both an IOS and web developer, James enrolled in a 3 month Web Development intensive bootcamp to learn the
skills needed to overcome this roadblock. Now, at the age of 20, with the development of both the website and mobile app well underway, he plans on partnering up with universities and including drone tours for the users benefit.

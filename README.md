# Portfolio-
I Built this Portfolio to show employers the projects I have worked on since becoming a web developer. 
Built purely using HTML/CSS/Javascript.
I wanted to challange myself with this portfolio by hand making every css position while also making it media friendly across several platforms. 
This forced me to refamiliarize myself with @media queries. 
It is current deployed on Heroku using a short PHP script. 
The portfolio is viewable on the following devices: 
 *13.3 inch MacBook Pro 
 * 24 inch Mac Desktop 
 * Galaxy S5
 * Nexus 5X 
 * Nexus 6P 
 * Iphone 5
 * Iphone 6 
 * iPhone 6 Plus
